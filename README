INTRODUCTION
============

This bundle is the Trumpton Apps Accessible tools.

downloadapps-https.sh / downloadapps-ssh.sh
-------------------------------------------

This script downloads the applications from the 
git repository.

The tools should then be built as MSVC2019_64
applications using QT 6.7.3


pullupdates.sh
--------------

This script downloads any updates that have been
made to each application from the git repository.

Building Linux
--------------

To build, from a command line prompt, run dobuildlin.sh all.  This will build
the files into the build folder, then copy the executables into the bin
folder.  Libraries are not copied, and are expected to be available in the
standard lib folders.

Building Windows
----------------

If a new pull has been done, ensure that you remove the subdirectories 
under 'build' - this is because the version acquisition lines in the pro
files affect compiler switches, but do not 'dirty' the resulting makefiles.

To build, open a Visual C command line prompt, and run winshell.bat (this
will set all the required environment variables up). 

Then, to build, run dobuildwin.bat -  this will build the files into the 
build folder, then copy the executables into the bin folder, and copy 
across all of the relevant DLLs.

Deploying Windows
-----------------

Edit the deploy/config/config-win64-6.7.3.xml, and ensure that the
version number, and web repository location are correct.

The deployment assumes that Git has been installed.

Run deploywin.sh from a bash prompt - this will create the repository
installation files in the repository folder, using information from the
deploy folder.

Individual Package xml files for apps such as ContactManager are 
automatically created to include the version number from the appropriate 
version.h file.

If the dlls are updated (say through a change in the compiler libraries), 
the core package version in com.trumpton.base must be manually modified.

If the example files change, or the copyfiles app is modified, the 
examplefiles package (com.trumpton.base.exampleconfiguration) version 
must be manually changed.

Output Files will end up in 'repository'.  
The online files must be uploaded to vizier.

QT6 under Linux
===============

Under Linux, if QT has been installed from the QT repository, several 
dependencies may also need to be installed:

sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0 libspa-lib-0.1 clang libspa-bluetooth
