INTRODUCTION
============

This bundle is the Trumpton Apps Accessible tools.

downloadapps.sh
---------------

This script downloads the applications from the 
git repository.

The tools should then be built as MSVC2015_64
applications.



pullupdates.sh
--------------

This script downloads any updates that have been
made to each application from the git repository.



deploywin.sh
------------

This script builds the distribution repository using
information from the deploy folder.

The Package xml files for ContactManager, EasyNotepad 
and ParseWeb are automatically created to include the 
version number from the appropriate version.h file.

If the dlls are updated (say through a change in the
compiler libraries), the core package version must
be manually modified.

If the example files change, or the copyfiles app
is modified, the examplefiles package version must
be manually changed.
