INTRODUCTION
============

This bundle is the Trumpton Apps Accessible tools.

downloadapps.sh
---------------

This script downloads the applications from the 
git repository.

The tools should then be built as MSVC2015_64
applications using QT 5.10.1.


pullupdates.sh
--------------

This script downloads any updates that have been
made to each application from the git repository.

Building Linux
--------------

To build, from a command line prompt, run dobuildlin.sh.  This will build
the files into the build folder, then copy the executables into the bin
folder.  Libraries are not copied, and are expected to be available in the
standard lib folders.

Building Windows
----------------

To build, open a Visual C command line prompt, and run dobuildwin.bat
This will build the files into the build folder, then copy the executables
into the bin folder, and copy across all of the relevant DLLs.

Deploying Windows
-----------------

Edit the deploy/config/config-win64-5.10.1.xml, and ensure that the
version number, and web repository location are correct.

The deployment assumes that Git has been installed.

Run deploywin.sh from a bash prompt - this will create the repository
installation files in the repository folder, using information from the
deploy folder.

Individual Package xml files for apps such as ContactManager are 
automatically created to include the version number from the appropriate 
version.h file.

If the dlls are updated (say through a change in the compiler libraries), 
the core package version in com.trumpton.base must be manually modified.

If the example files change, or the copyfiles app is modified, the 
examplefiles package (com.trumpton.base.exampleconfiguration) version 
must be manually changed.

Output Files will end up in 'repository'.  
The online files must be uploaded to vizier.
